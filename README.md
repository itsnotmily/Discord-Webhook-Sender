   - Makes API calls to external services (e.g., PokeAPI) to fetch dynamic content like PokÃ©mon details, logs, or updates.
   - Formats the data into beautifully structured Discord messages using embeds.
2. **Send to Discord:**
   - Sends the formatted messages to a Discord channel using a webhook URL.
   - Messages can include rich content, including text, images, and embedded fields. 
3. **Automation via GitHub Actions**:
   - Configured to run daily or hourly based on the project.
   - Automates message delivery without manual intervention.

1. Trigger Frequency:
   â€¢ Daily Trigger: Sends a message every day at 9 AM GMT.
   â€¢ Manual Trigger: Sends a message when triggered (optional).

2. Setup Instructions:
   â€¢ The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/pokemondiscord.yml.
   â€¢ No additional configuration is required unless you modify the schedule.

3. Secure Webhook URL:
   â€¢ Set the webhook URL as a GitHub Actions secret:
   â€¢ Navigate to your repository's Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
   â€¢ Add a new secret called DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL and paste your webhook URL.
    
## Customization

   â€¢ You can customize the script to send different types of notifications.
   â€¢ Replace the PokÃ©mon logic with your own data source or API.
